# Learning Notes – Sprint 09: Lightning Web Components
## 1. Lightning Web Components

Lightning Web Components (LWC) are used to build interactive user interfaces in Salesforce.

An LWC mainly contains:

- HTML for the user interface
- JavaScript for component behavior
- XML metadata for component configuration
## 2. Data Binding

Data binding allows JavaScript properties to be displayed in the HTML template.

For example, job information retrieved from Apex can be displayed in the component.

## 3. Wire Service

The @wire service is useful for retrieving reactive data.

In the Eligible Jobs component, @wire is used to retrieve the eligible jobs for a student.

## 4. Imperative Apex

Imperative Apex is useful when an Apex method should execute because of a specific user action.

The Apply button is an example of this.

The flow is:
```text
User Action
    ↓
JavaScript
    ↓
Imperative Apex
    ↓
Apex Controller
```

## 5. Parent and Child Components

Large interfaces can be divided into smaller components based on responsibility.

In this sprint:
```text
eligibleJobs
    |
    └── jobCard
```

The parent manages the overall job list, while the child displays an individual job.

## 6. Parent-to-Child Communication

The parent passes job information to the child component using @api.

This allows each jobCard to receive the job that it needs to display.

## 7. Child-to-Parent Communication

A child component can communicate with its parent using Custom Events.

When the student clicks Apply:

```text
jobCard
    ↓
Custom Event
    ↓
eligibleJobs
```


The selected Job Id is sent to the parent.

## 8. Business Logic and UI

Business rules should not be duplicated in JavaScript.

The LWC requests the application, while the Apex business layer decides whether the application is valid.

Existing rules such as:

- Duplicate application prevention
- CGPA validation
- Application deadline validation

remain in the backend.

## 9. Loading and Processing States

A good interface should communicate what is happening.

The Apply button can move through states such as:
```text
Apply
  ↓
Submitting...
  ↓
Success / Failure
```

This also helps prevent accidental repeated clicks.

## 10. Success and Error Handling

Every user action should have a clear result.

Successful application:

Application submitted successfully.

If the application fails, the component displays an error message instead of leaving the user without feedback.

## 11. Refreshing Data

After a successful application, the data displayed on the screen may become outdated.

Refreshing the wired data helps keep the interface synchronized with the Salesforce data.

## 12. Complete Application Flow

The complete flow learned in this sprint is:
```text
Student
   ↓
Lightning Web Component
   ↓
Job Card
   ↓
Custom Event
   ↓
Apex Controller
   ↓
Service Layer
   ↓
Business Rules
   ↓
Salesforce Data
```

## Key Takeaways
- LWC separates presentation from component behavior.
- @wire is useful for reactive data retrieval.
- Imperative Apex is useful for user-initiated actions.
-@api supports parent-to-child communication.
-Custom Events support child-to-parent communication.
-Business rules should remain in the backend.
-Loading, success, and error states improve user experience.
-Components should be divided according to responsibility.
-UI and backend architecture should work together to complete a business workflow.
